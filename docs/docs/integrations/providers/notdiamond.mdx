# Not Diamond

[Not Diamond](https://notdiamond.ai) offers an AI model router that automatically determines which LLM is best suited to respond to any query,
improving LLM output quality by combining multiple LLMs into a **meta-model** that learns when to call each LLM.

Not Diamond supports cost and latency tradeoffs, customized router training, and real-time router personalization.
Not Diamond also supports many - but not all - models supported by Langchain. See [here][supported] for details.

Learn more via [the documentation][docs].

## Installation

```shell
pip install langchain notdiamond
```

## Configuration

- API keys: You need an API key from [Not Diamond](api-keys) as well as any LLM you want to use.

## Quick Start

Set up your Python environment with a client and prompt:

```python
from langchain_community.utilities.notdiamond import NotDiamondRunnable, NotDiamondRoutedRunnable

prompt = "Try to convert Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley to a haiku."
```

### Router recommendations with `NotDiamondRunnable`

First, Not Diamond offers `NotDiamondRunnable`, which recommends a model for the given prompt or chain.

```python
nd_runnable = NotDiamondRunnable(
    nd_api_key="sk-...", nd_llm_configs=["openai/gpt-4o", "openai/gpt-4o-mini"]
)
print(nd_runnable.model_select(prompt))
```

The recommendation is returned as a string, allowing you to apply business logic as needed:

```python
"openai/gpt-4o"
```

### Auto-routing with `NotDiamondRoutedRunnable`

Not Diamond also offers `NotDiamondRoutedRunnable` which instead dynamically routes the input as part of a chain.

```python
nd_routed_runnable = NotDiamondRoutedRunnable(
    nd_api_key="sk-...", nd_llm_configs=["openai/gpt-4o", "openai/gpt-4o-mini"]
)
print(nd_runnable.invoke(prompt))

# or: chain = nd_routed_runnable | other_runnable | third_runnable
#     chain.invoke(prompt)
```

This will directly invoke the model recommended by Not Diamond:

```
# ND selected gpt-4o for this prompt
content="Ancient kingâ€™s great fall, Desert sands reclaim his pride, Time erases all." additional_kwargs=....
```

### Configuring a `NotDiamond` client

Both of these runnables also accept a configured `NotDiamond` client:

```python
nd_client = NotDiamond(
    llm_configs=[LLMConfig("openai", "gpt-4o"), LLMConfig("openai", "gpt-4o-mini")],
    api_key=os.getenv("NOTDIAMOND_API_KEY"),
    default=LLMConfig("openai", "gpt-4o"),
    tradeoff="cost",
    ...
)
nd_routed_runnable = NotDiamondRoutedRunnable(nd_client=nd_client)
print(nd_routed_runnable.invoke("What is 2+2?"))
```

The router identifies the simplicity of this query and trades off cost for accuracy by selecting
a cheaper model:

```
# ND routed to gpt-4o-mini
content="2 + 2 equals 4." additional_kwargs=...
```
